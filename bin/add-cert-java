#    To go to Artifactory open: https://afeoscyc-mw.cec.lab.emc.com/artifactory/webapp
# - Use your browser's facilities to view the certificate
#    In firefox, click on the little (i) icon to the left of the URL
#    In the resulting drop down, click on '>' to the right of 'afeoscyc-mw.cec.lab.emc.com'
#    At the bottom of that resulting drop down click on 'more information'
#    In the resulting window click on 'view certificate'
#    In the subsequent window, select 'details' on the top
#    In the subsequent window, select 'export' on the bottom left
#    Now save the certificate to a file
